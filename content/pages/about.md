  - "I write as a builder who cares about calm interfaces and deliberate systems. This archive is where design notes, product decisions, and motion experiments live side by side."
  - "Each entry is a small dossier: what I observed, why it mattered, and how the choice holds up over time."
  - "If you are here for practical patterns, start with the posts. If you are here for taste, read the principles and the FAQ."

## The work

This site is a long-form notebook for product design and engineering decisions. I keep the writing close to the work: a project, a question, a constraint, and the choice that follows.

The goal is not volume. The goal is clarity. Each piece should help you understand a system, a trade-off, or a way of composing motion that respects the reader.

## The archive

Everything is stored in Markdown and tracked in Git. That is the point: the archive is portable, inspectable, and long-lived. It also means updates are easy to maintain and easy to trace.

The posts are designed to read well on small screens, and to keep headings and highlights scannable for people who are browsing quickly.

## How I write

I write to keep a decision from becoming a guess later. That means the writing favors reasons over outcomes, and is honest about what did not work.

If a system makes it into this archive, it is because it will matter a year from now.
