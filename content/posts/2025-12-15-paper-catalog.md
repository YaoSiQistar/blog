Catalog lists should feel like a magazine index: quiet, structured, and easy to
scan. Titles carry the emphasis while metadata sits in a lighter voice.

We avoid heavy cards and rely on thin rules, soft hover emphasis, and tight
vertical rhythm. The spacing system is tuned for both mobile and wide viewports.
