The design system is anchored by a warm paper palette and two primary typefaces.
UI elements stay on Inter while long-form reading uses a serif that matches the
editorial tone.

Tokens are mapped directly to shadcn variables so every component inherits the
same background, border, and ring colors without custom overrides.
