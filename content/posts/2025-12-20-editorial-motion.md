# Editorial Motion Notes

Motion should feel like a breath, not a spectacle. The transition system uses
three layers: content, film, and ink. Each layer has a single purpose and stays
within strict limits for blur and opacity.

The shared element system is the continuity anchor. Titles and covers are
tracked by layout IDs so the page change feels like a continuous layout rather
than a cut.

Future adjustments will favor less movement, smaller easing curves, and an even
lighter hand on the ink layer.
