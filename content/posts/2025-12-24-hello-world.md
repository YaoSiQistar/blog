Welcome to the new editorial workspace. This repository is now the single source
of truth for long-form writing, short notes, and system documentation.

The goal is to keep the writing process simple: write in Markdown, commit to Git,
and let the site surface the latest work with consistent typography and motion.

In the coming weeks we will refine the catalog layout, add richer Markdown
rendering, and connect engagement data without compromising the reading flow.
